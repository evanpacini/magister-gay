# Magister: Gay Editionâ„¢
A follow-up on my previous project, _Magister: Pink Edition_, availible [here](https://github.com/evanpacini/magister-pink).
This version aims to offer an endless amount of themes for magister, together with a huge amount of customisation possibilities.

**Nota Bene:** The name of this project is solely inspired by the rainbow flag, as it contains all of the colours, just as your magister can once you use this extension.
It is in no way meant to hurt or offend any member of the LGBT+ comunity.
